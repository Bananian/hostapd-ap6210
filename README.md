hostapd for Banana Pro (ap6210)
-------------------------------

This repo contains hostapd-2.4 with ap6210 driver support for Banana Pro and build manifests to package it as a .deb file. This was tested to build and work on Banana Pro (Allwinner A20) running Bananian 15.08 (Jessie, kernel 3.4.108).
